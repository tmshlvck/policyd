policyd.py -- simple policy daemon for Postfix

There are much more complicated pieces of software that can act as policy
daemons for Postfix SMTP access policy delegation as described in
http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html which are undoubtedly
good and solid.

But I needed something simple and customizable that can:

- block compromised SASL accounts that are sending SPAM in large quentities
- block IP addresses either in mynetworks or from the Internet that do so

And these simple tasks should be done on a single server, in short time
periods and with fairly low ammount of e-mail.

Another wish was not to use any SQL database nor files as data storage
backend. So the daemon stores all it's data in memory, which is acceptable
cosidering low traffic and fact that it only blocks accounts and IP addresses.
